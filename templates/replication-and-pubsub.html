  <h1>Replication and Pub/Sub</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Redis supports two models of distributed data processing across
    different machines. Redis's master-slave replication
    is simple to use with horizontal scaling across multiple 
    slaves connecting asynchronous with a master Redis instance. 
    In addition, Redis is well suited to supporting the 
    Publish/Subscribe model where publisher send messages to one 
    or more channels that subscribes monitor and then react to the
    messaging queue.
